\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame to write to disk}

\item{path}{Path or connection to write to.}

\item{delim}{Delimiter used to separate values. Defaults to \code{" "} for \code{write_delim()}, \code{","} for \code{write_excel_csv()} and
\code{";"} for \code{write_excel_csv2()}. Must be a single character.}

\item{na}{String used for missing values. Defaults to NA. Missing values
will never be quoted; strings with the same value as \code{na} will
always be quoted.}

\item{append}{If \code{FALSE}, will overwrite existing file. If \code{TRUE},
will append to existing file. In both cases, if file does not exist a new
file is created.}

\item{col_names}{Write columns names at the top of the file? Must be either
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.}

\item{quote_escape}{The type of escaping to use for quoted values, one of
"double", "backslash" or "none". You can also use \code{FALSE}, which is
equivalent to "none". The default is to double the quotes, which is the
format excel expects.}

\item{eol}{The end of line character to use. Most commonly either "\n" for
Unix style newlines, or "\r\n" for Windows style newlines.}
}
\value{
\verb{write_*()} returns the input \code{x} invisibly.
}
\description{
This is about twice as fast as \code{\link[=write.csv]{write.csv()}}, and never
writes row names. \code{output_column()} is a generic method used to coerce
columns to suitable output.
}
\section{Output}{

Factors are coerced to character. Doubles are formatted using the grisu3
algorithm. POSIXct's are formatted as ISO8601 with a UTC timezone \emph{Note:
\code{POSIXct} objects in local or non-UTC timezones will be converted to UTC time
before writing.}

All columns are encoded as UTF-8. \code{write_excel_csv()} and \code{write_excel_csv2()} also include a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark}{UTF-8 Byte order mark}
which indicates to Excel the csv is UTF-8 encoded.

\code{write_excel_csv2()} and \code{write_csv2} were created to allow users with
different locale settings save csv files with their default settings \verb{;} as
column separator and \verb{,} as decimal separator. This is common in some European countries.

Values are only quoted if needed: if they contain a comma, quote or newline.

The \verb{write_*()} functions will automatically compress outputs if an appropriate extension is given. At present, three
extensions are supported, \code{.gz} for gzip compression, \code{.bz2} for bzip2 compression and \code{.xz} for lzma compression.  See
the examples for more information.
